# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev                                   # run with tsx (no build step)
npm run build                                 # esbuild → dist/cli.js (single ESM bundle)
npm run start                                 # run the built bundle
npm run typecheck                             # tsc --noEmit (always run before finishing a change)

node --import tsx/esm scripts/snapshot.mjs    # render every screen to stdout for layout review
```

There is no test runner. `scripts/snapshot.mjs` uses `ink-testing-library` and is the closest we have — it exercises all screens with synthetic data, which is useful after touching UI primitives or screen layout.

The tool requires a real TTY. `npm run dev` works in a terminal; piping it or running it inside a subprocess without a PTY will error out by design (`src/cli.tsx`).

## Core model

Three disk locations, two roles:

| Path | Role | Modifications |
|---|---|---|
| `~/Repository/` | source repos (scanned recursively, depth 8) | never mutated except via `git worktree add/remove/repair`, `git branch -m/-D`, `git fetch` |
| `~/Work Forests/<forest>/` | forest root (= branch-working-copy-group) | owned by this tool |
| `~/Work Forests/<forest>/<repo>/` | individual worktree | created by `git worktree add`; contains real working tree |

**Key invariant**: a forest's name equals the branch name used in every constituent worktree. There is no separate worktree name. Rename means: move the folder, rename the branch in every repo, `git worktree repair` each worktree, update the `.code-workspace` file. All of this lives in `core/forest.renameForest`.

**Key invariant**: the tool is robust to users deleting things in Finder. `loadForestByPath` returns `null` on a missing/invalid meta file; `listForests` silently skips such directories.

## Architecture layers

```
src/cli.tsx              alt-screen setup, process signal handlers, ink render
 └─ src/app.tsx          route state machine + in-memory forest list + toast slot
     ├─ src/screens/*    one screen per route, no routing logic of their own
     └─ src/ui/*         primitives (Header, Footer, SelectList, TextInput, …)

src/core/*               pure domain logic, no React
 ├─ forest.ts            create/add/remove/rename/delete + refresh (see below)
 ├─ git.ts               thin execFile wrapper, one function per git verb
 ├─ ide.ts               Cursor + Claude Code launchers
 ├─ workspace.ts         <forest>.code-workspace read/write/rename
 ├─ repo-scanner.ts      walks ~/Repository respecting IGNORED_DIRS
 ├─ fuzzy.ts             fuzzysort wrapper returning match indices
 └─ paths.ts             path helpers + name validation
```

Screens receive callbacks from `app.tsx` (`onOpen`, `onEdit`, `onDelete`, …). They never `setRoute` directly, never touch the filesystem themselves — they render and dispatch. This keeps the state machine auditable in one file.

## Non-obvious patterns to preserve

**Never block on the network.** `gitDefaultBranch` resolves from cached `origin/HEAD`, then local remote-tracking refs (`origin/main|master|develop`), then local branches, and only as a last resort runs `git remote set-head --auto` (with a final fallback to the current `HEAD`). `gitFetch` is called with `void` (fire-and-forget) per repo, right after that repo's worktree has been attached/added. Adding a blocking fetch back into `createForest` or `addWorktreeToForest` will regress the UX by seconds-to-minutes per repo on VPN/slow remotes.

**Per-repo operations run in parallel where independence allows.** `createForest` uses `Promise.allSettled` for both the main pass and the rollback on partial failure. `refreshWorktreeStatuses` uses `Promise.all` with per-item try/catch (so failures don't reject the outer promise). `deleteForest` currently walks repos sequentially with `for … of` so step reporting stays linear — each step (`removing`/`pruning`, then `deleting branch`) is emitted per repo. Don't reintroduce `for … of` loops elsewhere unless there is a real ordering constraint (there usually isn't — each repo is independent).

**Home doesn't call `gitStatus`.** `reloadForests` in `app.tsx` only calls `listForests()`. Git status is refreshed inside the Edit screen on mount, because only Edit shows it. If you add status to Home, do it async without blocking reloadForests.

**Toasts flow through the footer.** `showToast` in `app.tsx` sets a time-limited message that Home passes into `Footer`'s `status` slot. There is no overlay component. A toast replaces the rightmost status text for ~3s, then the default status (e.g. forest count) returns.

**Alt-screen buffer.** `cli.tsx` writes `\x1b[?1049h` on start and restores with `\x1b[?1049l` in an `exit` handler plus SIGINT/SIGTERM. If you add another exit path (e.g. a hard `process.exit()` from inside the app), make sure it goes through `restore()` first or the scrollback stays corrupted.

**IDE handoff modes differ on purpose.** Cursor opens detached via `spawn` and prefers the `.code-workspace` file (generated by `core/workspace`). Claude Code opens via `osascript` against iTerm2 — new tab in the current window, fallback to new window. The Ink app keeps running in both cases; there is no longer a process handoff.

**Workspace file is synchronized, not authored-once.** `createForest`, `addWorktreeToForest`, `removeWorktreeFromForest`, and `renameForest` all call `writeWorkspaceFile` / `renameWorkspaceFile` at the end. If you add another forest-mutation path, keep this in sync or Cursor will open a stale workspace.

## UI design language

Utility/Helix-inspired. One magenta accent, semantic green/yellow/red only for status. No panel borders, no decorative dividers — whitespace and bold carry hierarchy. Labels are English and compact (`move`, `open`, `new`, not `navigieren`). Symbols are semantic, not decorative. The theme exposes nine (`▸ ✓ ! × + > … ↑ ↓` in `ui/theme.ts`) for cursor/status/prompts; Home adds three metadata glyphs inline (`◆` worktree count, `◷` time, `⌁` repos). Don't add decorative ones.

The Footer component renders a Helix-style statusbar: inverted magenta mode prefix on the left, hints in the middle, right-aligned status/toast slot. Every screen passes a `mode` string that appears both in the header and the statusbar prefix.

Time is always relative-compact (`2h ago`, `3d ago`) via `ui/format.formatRelativeTime`. Paths are collapsed via `ui/format.compactPath` (`~/…`). Long names truncate in the middle via `truncateMiddle`.

## Forest meta format

Each forest stores a `.workforests.json` at version 2. The tool only reads v2. Bumping the version means writing a migration in `loadForestByPath`, not a silent read.

## README

The top-level `README.md` has the user-facing concept overview, installation steps, and disk layout. Keyboard shortcuts in README may lag behind the actual bindings — when in doubt, the footer hints in each screen are authoritative.
